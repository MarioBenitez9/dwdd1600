            <h1>WW2</h1>
            <h2>World War II (1939-1945) was a global conflict between the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) and the Allied powers (primarily Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union).</h2>
            <p>Sparked by Nazi German <strong>aggresion</strong> in Europe and Japanese expansionism in Asia, the war ultimately became the <strong>deadliest</strong> conflict in <em>human history.</em></p>

            <h2>Why the United States joined the war</h2>
       <ol>
    <li>The Attack on Pearl Harbor:** The direct cause of the United States joining World War II was the surprise attack by the Empire of Japan on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941. This unprovoked attack led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to declare war on Japan the following day.</li>
    <li>Declarations of War from Germany and Italy:** In response to the U.S. declaration of war against Japan, Germany and Italy—Japan's allies through the Tripartite Pact—declared war on the United States just four days later, on December 11, 1941. This officially brought the U.S. into the European conflict against the Axis powers.</li>
    <li>Support for the Allies:** Even before the attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. was moving away from strict neutrality to support the Allied nations. The Lend-Lease Act, passed in March 1941, allowed the U.S. to supply war materials to countries like Great Britain and the Soviet Union, providing critical aid in their fight against Germany.</li>
    <li>Japanese Expansionism in Asia:** Long before Pearl Harbor, tensions had been rising between the U.S. and Japan due to Japan's aggressive imperial expansion in Asia, particularly its invasion of China. The U.S. condemned this aggression and imposed economic sanctions, which further escalated the conflict.</li>
    <li>German Aggression and Naval Attacks:** Growing concern over Nazi Germany's expansion in Europe and German U-boat attacks on ships in the Atlantic also pushed the U.S. closer to war. President Roosevelt authorized U.S. Navy ships to escort Allied convoys and issued a "shoot on sight" order against German vessels, effectively beginning a naval war in the Atlantic.</li>
